<h1>Cassandra on Blue Waters</h1>

<p>Distributed key-value stores running on commodity machines have become very popular, as cloud computing has become affordable and approachable. However, possibility of running such systems in high performance machines has been overlooked. We investigate the characteristics of a distributed key-value store running on a supercomputer and compare with the distributed key-value store running on commodity machines.</p>

<p>This work was done in Advanced Distributed Systems course at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign under professor Indranil Gupta.</p>
