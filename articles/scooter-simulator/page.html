	OculuScooter is a virtual scooter simulator which uses a physical scooter handle and user's own foot as inputs. 
	We built our own scooter using PVC pipes. We used a rotation sensor to detect the precise angle of the scooter handle. For roller skate, we attached a LED and a photo diode, and put a reflective marker on a wheel to detect the rotations per second(RPM) of the roller skate wheel and converted it to the user's kicking motion in the virtual scooter.
	We used <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus Rift DK2</a> and <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 4</a> as our development platform. For hardware parts, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and <a href="http://www.spark.io">Spark Core</a> were used for integrating the rotation sensor inputs and wireless roller skate inputs, respectively.
	The <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/oculuscooter">older version of OculuScooter</a> was initially made in <a href="http://hackillinois.org">HackIllinois 2015</a>. The new version features significantly improved handle's rotation detection, improved roller skate RPM measurement algorithm, ability to move in backward direction, and more beautiful scenery of course.
	The cost for building our system was somewhere under 150 dollars, where most of it were spent at roller skate($50), micro controllers($25 * 2), and PVC pipes($20).

  	Our project is inspired by <a href="http://somniacs.co/">Birdly</a>, a VR bird simulatior where a user can fly in the virtual space by intuitively flapping the wings.
  	We were interested in pursuing a solution to find a good way to navigate in VR, because many existing solutions cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness">VR sicknesses</a> due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusions_of_self-motion#Vection">vection</a>, or rather disorienting in case of teleport based systems.
	However, when we were introduced to the Birdly simulator, we noticed that <a href="http://www.tested.com/art/makers/463385-hands-birdly-virtual-reality-flight-simulator/">many people who tried it reported little or no sickness</a> while or after using it. 
	Therefore, we believed that the key to reducing the VR sickness is to generate the physically immersive experiences&mdash;in our case, it's controlling of the handle and the foot movement&mdash;so that the user's focus is deviated from vestibular mismatches caused by the simulator.
	Majority of our users told us that they didn't feel sick or nauseous, which is a great sign considering the significant amount of linear and angular accelerations caused in our simulator.
