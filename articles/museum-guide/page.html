<p>This is a museum guide made for the <a href="http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/">Spurlock Museum</a> of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The goal of this project was to create a museum guide that takes a subset of artifacts in ancient mediterranian gallery, and demonstrate an interesting story combining picked artifacts.</p>

<p>It turned out the meat of this project was not becoming an expert in the ancient greek democratic process (which I kind of achieved as a side effect), but to experience the process of interactive design, where there were real users who tested my design to achieve their goal of navigating inside the Spurlock museum, and gave me valuable feedbacks.</p>

<p>The hardest part was helping the users to physically navigate inside the gallery to find the right artifacts. After a little bit of frustration, I came up with an idea that creating a 3-dimensional map would help people navigate through the space a lot easier. Therefore, I went ahead with Illustrator’s 3-D extrusion and rotation features to create a 3-D map of the Spurlock museum’s Ancient Mediterranean gallery. As it turned out, the 3-D map appeared to help most people navigating through the space, especially since unlike other rooms, the Ancient Mediterranean gallery had a noticeable wall and an arch structure.</p>

<p>Lastly, one thing that many people noticed and pleasantly responded was the fact that I put the front and the back images of the same artifact on the both sides of the guide’s cover. Such placement of cover photos seemed to stimulate the curiosity of the viewer to imagine the back side of other artifacts as well.</p>
