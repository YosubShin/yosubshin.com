<p>This is the project where I had to create an educational poster for a historical event targeted for high school students.
In this project, I learned to manage and execute a big graphic design project which spans multiple iterations and requires to present wide range of ideas. In retrospect, this made me realize how much effort and expertise are put into posters that I run into everyday.</p>

<p>The first challenge for me was to pick a historical event that suits well as a topic for a poster design. I initially explored ideas such as the history of the bridge technology and the history of computer, but former turned out to be too hard to structure a well defined hierarchy or timeline because the works done on bridge building was sporadic and hard to embed into a series of sequential events, and the latter, although it suits my interests perfectly, was too recent to satisfy the project requirements. In that regard, the Manhattan Project turned out to be a very good topic because it has so many information available, and it was relatively easy to structure the event into a poster because of its sequential nature.</p>

<p>Once I started researching to create the first iteration of the poster, I felt completely stuck despite I spent many hours in library for many consecutive days. Having to structure a poster from scratch and laying out a sequence of the rich historical events in meaningful ways seemed to be almost impossible. In the end, I finally digested the bigger picture of the event and I was able to pop out the first iteration of the poster. One interesting thing I want to mention is that before I had a concrete idea of how to lay things out in InDesign, it really helped to draw a rough layout on my tablet and see what the end product is going to look like before committing too much.</p>

<p>As my poster got more mature in the latter iterations, I received a few negative feedbacks which pointed out:(1) Although my way of organizing objects is good, at the same time it doesn’t seem to have nice hierarchy or global structure to guide a viewer. (2) My choice of color is too boring and the poster seems to monotonous. I agreed to both points, but at that point it was hard to tear apart what I already did and come up with an entirely new thing. Then again, I used the same technique that I used in the iteration 0 to layout the items from scratch. Last time, I had trouble guiding users through the various aspects of the events such as scientific background, the atomic bomb development operations, bombing of Japan, and the aftermath of the bombing. One theory of  the cause of my problem was that non-proportional amount of contents for each section caused me to shuffle around the contents a bit randomly, therefore confusing the audience. Also it was apparent that devoting significant horizontal space at bottom of the poster for timeline was limiting my freedom for laying out contents even more.</p>

<p>Consequently, I came up with a new vertically split layout with vertical timeline and an interesting infographic at the left side and the more traditional grid contents on the right. This solved all of my problems as I was now able to vertically layout the contents without having to worry about shuffling the contents in worry of filling the grids uniformly. Also having two contrasting themes on the left and right side of the poster with a dramatic moment on the background image instantly made my poster to become exciting and lively.</p>

<p>In the end, as I described my iteration processes, it was such a nice opportunity to manage a big project and make incremental progresses under continuous feedback cycle. It was also nice to see other people’s posters maturing into masterpieces. I think this project was clearly worth the pain that I had to overcome while I was trying to come up with everything from nothing.</p>
