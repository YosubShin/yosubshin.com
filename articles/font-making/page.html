<p>I created a font inspired by Steve Jobs' famous quote on connecting the dots. It is called 'Connect The Dots', and as you can see in the quote above, I connected the dots with straight lines to generate character forms. Due to lack of curves, it was tricky to come up with characters such as 'B' and 'G'. Maintaing reasonable widths for different characters was also a challenge.</p>

<p>For this project, I used a convenient online font making tool called <a href="http://www.fontstruct.com">fontstruct.com</a>. It lets you create a font on their website by filling grid blocks with various shapes. Once you make a font, you can download the font binary for free and use it in other applications.</p>
