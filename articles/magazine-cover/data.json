	"shortDescription": "In this project, I created a fictional magazine after a famous house sharing and traveling startup called ‘Airbnb’. It was a natural choice for me as it has a lot of possibilities for getting nice images, and as a devoted user of the website, I have rich background on their identity and what they are about."
