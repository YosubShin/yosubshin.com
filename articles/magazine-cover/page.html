<p>In this project, I created a fictional magazine after a famous house sharing and traveling startup called ‘<a href="http://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>’. It was a natural choice for me as it has a lot of possibilities for getting nice images, and as a devoted user of the website, I have rich background on their identity and what they are about.</p>

<p>My initial ideas on image system was to use photography of one of the Airbnb listings or creating an illustration of representative figure of the city that the issue is targeting on. After the initial study, I quickly realized that it is hard to get high-resolution images of Airbnb listings, and thus I ended up combining an illustration of a city’s map and the collage of photos of the city taken from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Combined with grid system for textual information, it turned out to be a great direction to take.</p>

<p>In the latter iteration for additional covers, I pivoted my idea a little bit to exclusively go with distinct illustrations while maintaining the text system consistently. For the table of contents design, I went with a combination of different color tones with explicit square grids.</p>

<p>Overall, this was another interesting project where I had to push myself to go beyond my Illustrator skills, and to manage systems with multiple degrees of complexity(image system, text system, multiple issues, overall consistency, novelty of individual items).</p>
