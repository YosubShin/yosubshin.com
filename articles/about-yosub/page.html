<p>Yosub is a software engineer, graphic designer, and a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p>In Summer 2015, Yosub works as a software engineer intern at Google in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>Yosub also works as an undergraduate researcher in the Distributed Protocols Research Group at UIUC under professor Indranil Gupta. Yosub designed a system called Parqua that supports changing configurations of Apache Cassandra while maintaining the cluster online. He experimentally verified that the system scales well with numerous records in the database, and that availability is high while reconfiguration is being executed.

<p>Yosub also participated in the development of an open source embedded key-value database called RocksDB as a Facebook Open Academy program. He implemented the BW-Tree (a latch-free variant of B-Tree proposed by Microsoft Research) as an alternative memtable implementation in order to achieve better read performance.
